## 💬 My Work Readiness Journey

I am a student pursuing a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. As an integral part of my Work Readiness Training, I have created this e-portfolio to document and reflect on my professional growth, experiences, and evolving career aspirations.

Through various interactive activities—such as personality assessments, CV writing workshops, and comprehensive skills evaluations—I have gained a significantly deeper understanding of my individual strengths and areas for development. I've discovered that I am inherently detail-oriented, possess strong analytical abilities, and am genuinely passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems.

Initially, a significant challenge for me was articulating my diverse skillset effectively within the constraints of a CV and engaging in profound self-reflection regarding my personal and professional development. However, I am immensely proud of the progress I've made in enhancing my self-awareness, building confidence in my capabilities, and clearly identifying a focused career direction within the ICT sector. I now have a clear vision of my professional passions and am highly motivated to continue learning and improving my competencies.
